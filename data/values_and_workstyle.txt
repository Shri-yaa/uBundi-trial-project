\f0\fs24 \cf0 # My Values & Work Style\
\
## Core Values\
- Curiosity: I like to dig into problems until I really understand what\'92s going on.  \
- Integrity: I\'92d rather be transparent about what I know and don\'92t know than bluff.  \
- Collaboration: I believe the best work happens when people bring different perspectives together.  \
- Growth mindset: I see mistakes and setbacks as signals for learning.  \
\
## How I Work\
- Hands-on: I learn best by building prototypes and testing ideas quickly.  \
- Structured but flexible: I use plans and frameworks, but I\'92m comfortable improvising when the path isn\'92t clear.  \
- Communication: I like to explain things clearly, with examples or visuals when possible.  \
- Balance: I value productivity, but I also respect time outside of work.  \
\
## What Energizes Me\
- Solving challenging problems where the solution isn\'92t obvious.  \
- Turning raw data or theory into something tangible and useful.  \
- Collaborating with people who are passionate about their work.  \
\
## What Drains Me\
- Work that feels repetitive with no room for improvement.  \
- Environments with low trust or poor communication.  \
\
## Learning & Debugging\
- I start by breaking the problem into smaller parts and testing each step.  \
- I look at documentation or examples to guide me.  \
- I\'92m not afraid to ask for help or to experiment until I find a solution.  \
