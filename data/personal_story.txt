\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Personal Story\
\
My journey into data science started with a love for solving puzzles and finding patterns. At first, I was drawn to mathematics and probability, but I realised I enjoyed applying these ideas to real-world problems even more. That\'92s what led me to statistics and, later, data science and AI.\
\
One of my favourite experiences was building a neural network from scratch in R. It was tough, but it gave me a sense of pride because I could see how each mathematical piece clicked into the bigger system. \
\
I also love that my projects span different domains \'97 from wildlife conservation to financial risk. It shows me that the same statistical thinking can make a difference in very different worlds, and that excites me about the future of AI.\
