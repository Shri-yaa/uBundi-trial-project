\
## Peregrine Falcon Survival Analysis\
As part of my honours research thesis, I\'92ve been working with capture\'96mark\'96recapture data to estimate survival rates in Cape Town\'92s peregrine falcon population. I use Program MARK and Bayesian statistical methods to account for imperfect detection. This project matters to me because it blends rigorous modelling with real-world conservation impact, and it could contribute to published research. I\'92m proud of the way I built the models from first principles and communicated the findings clearly.\
\
## Portfolio Theory & Finance\
In my portfolio theory module, I\'92ve explored diversification, risk, and mean\'96variance optimisation. I\'92m proud of how I applied statistical and mathematical tools to financial data, building a deeper understanding of how correlation structures affect portfolio construction. This project pushed me to connect abstract theory with practical decision-making, which is a skill I want to keep developing.\
\
## Building Neural Networks from Scratch\
For my statistical computing coursework, I implemented a simple neural network entirely from scratch in R. I coded the full pipeline\'97forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent\'97without prebuilt libraries. I\'92m proud of this project because it showed me that I can build complex systems step by step, and it gave me a deeper appreciation of how modern AI models actually work.\
